# 🧪 DailyCodeLab

Welcome to **DailyCodeLab** — a multilingual coding playground for learning and practicing core programming concepts in **Swift**, **Python**, and **C#**.  
This project focuses on building a solid foundation using simple but powerful patterns like:

- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Search & Sort Algorithms**
- **Date & Time Handling**
- **Functional programming** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Stack implementation in Swift, Python, and C#
- 🚶‍♂️ Queue implementation in all 3 languages
- 🌳 Binary Tree with insert, in-order traversal, and find
- 🔗 Linked List with append, prepend, delete, and contains
- 🔍 Linear Search in all 3 languages
- 🌀 Bubble Sort in all 3 languages
- 🧠 Functional programming: map, filter, reduce
- 🕒 Date & Time formatting, parsing, localization, and manipulation
- ⚙️ Easy project setup with scripts
- 🧪 Daily code structure for learning by doing

## 🛠 Setup

From the root:

```bash
cd scripts
./setup_all.sh
```

This will create the `python/`, `swift/`, and `csharp/` playgrounds in one go inside `DailyCodeLab`.

## ▶️ How to Run

**Python**
```bash
cd python
python3 main.py
```

**Swift**
```bash
cd swift
swift run
```

**C#**
