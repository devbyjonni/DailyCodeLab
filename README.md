# 🧪 DailyCodeLab

Welcome to **DailyCodeLab** — a multilingual coding playground for learning and practicing core programming concepts in **Swift**, **Python**, and **C#**.  
This project focuses on building a solid foundation using simple but powerful patterns like **stacks** and **functional programming** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

---

## 📁 Structure

```
DailyCodeLab/
├── python/       # Python stack & functional examples
├── swift/        # Swift package with stack & functional demo
├── csharp/       # .NET console app with stack & LINQ examples
└── scripts/      # Setup scripts for each language
```

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Stack implementation in each language
- 🧠 Functional programming: map, filter, reduce
- 🧪 Daily code structure for hands-on practice
- ⚙️ Easy project setup using scripts

---

## 🛠 Setup

From the root:

```bash
cd scripts
./setup_all.sh
```

This will create the `python/`, `swift/`, and `csharp/` playgrounds in one go inside `DailyCodeLab`.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

**Python**
```bash
cd python
python3 main.py
```

**Swift**
```bash
cd swift
swift run
```

**C#**
```bash
cd csharp
dotnet run
```

## 💡 What’s Next

- Add queue and tree structures
- Explore error handling patterns
- Build mini apps for practice
- More functional challenges!
