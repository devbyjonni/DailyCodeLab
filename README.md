# 🧪 DailyCodeLab

Welcome to **DailyCodeLab** — a multilingual coding playground for learning and practicing core programming concepts in **Swift**, **Python**, and **C#**.  
This project focuses on building a solid foundation using simple but powerful patterns like:

- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Functional programming** (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)

---

## 📁 Structure

```
DailyCodeLab/
├── python/       # Python data structures & functional demos
├── swift/        # Swift package with all core structures & FP
├── csharp/       # .NET console app with data structures & LINQ
└── scripts/      # Setup scripts for each language
```

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Stack implementation in Swift, Python, and C#
- 🚶‍♂️ Queue implementation in all 3 languages
- 🌳 Binary Tree with insert, in-order traversal, and find
- 🔗 Linked List with append, prepend, delete, and contains
- 🧠 Functional programming: map, filter, reduce
- ⚙️ Easy project setup with scripts
- 🧪 Daily code structure for learning by doing

---

## 🛠 Setup

From the root:

```bash
cd scripts
./setup_all.sh
```

This will create the `python/`, `swift/`, and `csharp/` playgrounds in one go inside `DailyCodeLab`.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

**Python**
```bash
cd python
python3 main.py
```

**Swift**
```bash
cd swift
swift run
```

**C#**
```bash
cd csharp
dotnet run
```

---

## 💡 What’s Next

- Add more tree traversal methods (pre-order, post-order, breadth-first)
- Add doubly linked list
- Add search & sort algorithms
- Build console mini tools with these structures
- Add changelog & visual README badges
